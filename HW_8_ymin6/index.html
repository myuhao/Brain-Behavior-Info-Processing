  <h2>Finite State Machine</h2>

  <p>This assignment combines elements of action selection, finite-state machines (FSM), and area-restricted search (ARS) behavior.
    The goal is to develop a controller that collects as much energy as possible (100 max) in a fixed time period (2000 ticks).
    You will use an FSM controller to select among different stand-alone action patterns (behaviors)
    to achieve the desired performance.

  <h3>Scenario description</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 80%">
    <b>Pellets</b>
    <br>green pellets - randomly distributed; can be detected at a distance; worth 1 point each; 20 pellets = 20 points
    <br>invisible pellets - clustered; can only be detected by running into them; worth 5 points each; 16 pellets = 80 points
    <br><b>Bot sensory inputs</b>
    <br>bot.sns.left, bot.sns.right = intensity of green pellet scent (Braitenberg-style);
    <br>bot.sns.collision = true when the bot hits a boundary; false otherwise
    <br>bot.sns.deltaEnergy = energy gained on previous time step (+1 for green pellets, +5 for invisible pellets, 0 otherwise)
    <br><b>Bot motor outputs</b>
    <br>bot.mtr.left, bot.mtr.right = motor velocity (Braitenberg-style)
    <br><b>Sample controllers</b>
    <br>aggressive - a Braitenberg crossed-excitation wiring pattern
    <br>spiral - a sample spiral (non-optimal)
    <br>wander - random wandering
    <br>fsm1 - a finite-state machine that 'wanders' by default and 'spins' when it hits a boundary
    <br>fsm2 - you will use this slot to implement your own controller
    <br>&nbsp;
  </p>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>
   Develop and test a new FSM-based controller (fsm2) that effectively collects energy
   from the environment. Your target performance should be an average of 80 energy-points,
    or better, collected in 2000 ticks.
   (The best controllers from last year achieved results over 90.)
    Use 'Run Experiment' to collect statistics.
  </p><p>
   Part of your policy must include an area-restricted search (ARS) behavior that is
   triggered when the bot encounters an invisible pellet; the suggested ARS pattern
   is an outward spiraling trajectory that is likely to hit other invisible pellets
   (<a href="https://mcb419.github.io/hw/images/hw08.jpg">example trajectory</a>).
  </p><p>
   You will need to code individual state behaviors as stand-alone controller methods.
   Your FSM-code can make use of the provided stand-alone controllers
  (aggressive, spiral, and wander), which you are free to modify, and you can add additional new
  stand-along controllers of you own design.
   These stand-alone "building blocks" should only implement the specific behavior;
   they should not include the decisison-making rules on when to transition to a different state.
   All of the transition rules should be in your fsm2 code. More details will be provided in class.
  </p><p>
  NOTE: Only edit code in <code>bot.js</code>. Also, your controller should not use any information that is not available to the bot through
  its sensors (your controller code should not directly access bot position, pellet positions, etc.).
  </p>
  <h3>Questions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>List the individual "states" that you used in your fsm2 controller, with a one-line description of what each state does.<br>
      <user>
        <table style="width:100%">
          <tr>
            <th>States</th> <th>Descriptions</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><func>aggressiveFast()</func></td><td>Move towards sensible food at high speed.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><func>areaRestrictedSearch()</func></td><td>Sprial motions with randomness to explore the local area.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><func>spin()</func></td><td>Spin the agent in place for 15 ticks.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </user>
    </li>
    <li>For N states there are N<sup>2</sup> possible transition rules (allowing for states to transition to themselves).
      How many of those transitions were actually allowed by your fsm2 code?<br>
      <user>
        <p>Three states were used in the <func>fsm2()</func> finite-state machine, resulting in 9 possible transition rules.<br>
          In the implementation of <func>fsm2()</func>, 4 transition rules were explicitly stated. 3 rules that does not change the states were implicitly implemented in the switch block. In total, 7 rules were implemented.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>What part of the controller design and implementation did you find most challenging in this week's assignment?<br>
      <user>
        <p>The area restricted search is diffcult to implement in a Braitenberg model. The movement parameters have to be finely tuned to maximize the effceiency. Maybe genetic algorithm?
