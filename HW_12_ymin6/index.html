  <h2>Week 12 Neural Q-Learning</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This week we combine reinforcement learning with neural networks.  The important changes relative to last week are that
    <br>(a) the state space is now continuous, rather than discrete and
    <br>(b) Q values are estimated using a neural network, rather than a table.
  </p>
  <p>
  For this exercise, we will use a simple video game scenario, where the goal is
  to move a paddle left and right catch green pellets and avoid red pellets.
  We follow the general approach given in this week's reading assingment:
  <a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/mcb/419/pdf/Mnih15_529-533.pdf">
    Mnih V, et al. (2015) Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning. Nature 518, 539-533</a>.
   We will use the neural net library and reinforcement learning module documented here:
   <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html">ConvNetJS: Deep Q Learning Demo</a>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 80%">
    <b>Pellets:</b> red value = -1; green value = +1
    <br><b>Left/Right Sensors:</b> at each end of the paddle; provide information about distance to red and green pellets
    <br><b>Sensor values:</b> computed as (30/dist); e.g., an object 30 pixels away has a value of 1
    <br><b>Actions:</b> the bot has 3 actions; 0 = move left, 1 = move right; 2 = stop
    <br><b>Network input:</b> the four sensor values [leftRed, leftGreen, rightRed, rightGreen]
    <br><b>Network output:</b> estimated Q values for the 3 possible actions
    <br><b>Network internal layers:</b> you decide

  </table>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p> First, select "randAction" and click the "run series" button.  Look in the results table and you should see a value around 8-9.
  </p>
  <p>Before you can use reinforcement learning, you have to design your neural network by editing the code in the function
  <b>resetBrain</b> found in <b>sketch.js</b>.
  In particular, you'll need to specify one or more hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, the type of activation function
  in each layer ('relu', 'sigmoid', or 'tanh'). You may also want to change the associated parameters (epsilon, gamma, learning rate, batch_size, l2_decay, etc.)
  Note that <b>batch_size</b> has a big effect on the update rate... if you set it too large your simulation will run very slowly.
   You'll probably want to repeat the training series multiple times until the
  performance is no longer improving.
  Then you should select "testing" and then click "run series" to measure the final performance.
  </p>
  <p style="color:green"><b>NOTES:</b>
    <br>Your target performance should be above 20.
    <br>Save your best network directly into your HTML file by first clicking the "Save Network" button below, then copy-and-paste the network description from the textbox into the corresponding textarea section near the bottom of your HTML file.</p>

 <h3>Questions:</h3>
 <b>(provide answers in the body of your email, or in the HTML file, whichever you prefer)</b>
 <ol>
  <li>Did you remember to save your best network into your HTML file before submission?
    <br><user>your answer here</user>
   </li>
  <li>What was the average fitness that you achieved for your best network?
    <br><user>your answer here</user>
  </li>
  <li>How many training trials did it take to achieve this performance?
    <br><user>your answer here</user>
  </li>
  <li>Briefly describe the network architecture that you found to be most effective(e.g., #layers, #neurons, activation functions).
    <br><user>your answer here</user>
  </li>
   <li>Describe any changes that you made to the other learning parameters (the "opt" values).
     <br><user>your answer here</user>

  <h3>Load / Save network</h3>
  <p>These buttons will load/save the network architecture temporarily using the text box below.
  To save this information permanently, you would need to copy and paste the textbox contents
  into the appropriate section of the index.html file.
