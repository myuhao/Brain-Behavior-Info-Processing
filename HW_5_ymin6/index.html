  <user>
    In index.html, change ??? to the LAST 3 DIGITS of your UIN:
    <br>
    <input id="studentID" value="334" size="4" readonly="">
    <br>This value will be used to adjust the light intensity.
    <br>The simulation will not run until you complete this step.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>In this assignment you will explore different types of Braitenberg vehicles.
    The simulation environment has been provided for you.
    The only thing that you will need to change is the controller code for the different types of Braitenberg vehicles.
    <b>The main goal of the assignment is to understand how the controller architecture (crossed vs. uncrossed,
      excitatory vs. inhibitory) and controller parameters (gain and offset) influence the observed behaviors.</b>
  </p>


  <div id="canvas"></div>
  <select id="controller" onchange="reset()">
    <option value="aggressive">aggressive</option>
    <option value="coward">coward</option>
    <option value="explorer">explorer</option>
    <option value="love">love</option>
  </select>
  <button id="reset" onclick="reset()">Reset</button>
  <button id="run" onclick="run()">Run</button>
  <button id="stop" onclick="stop()">Stop</button>
  <br>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    The bots have two light sensors (snsL, snsR)
    and two motors (mtrL, mtrR).
    Sensor activation follows an inverse-square law.
    Motor activation corresponds to wheel velocity in pixels per tick.
  </p>
  <p>Your controller code in Bot.js should have the following form:
    </p><blockquote>
      <code>this.mtrL = OFFSET + GAIN * this.sns(L/R)<br>
        this.mtrR = OFFSET + GAIN * this.sns(L/R)</code>
    </blockquote>
    where OFFSET and GAIN are constant values. OFFSET must be positive.
    GAIN can be positive (excitatory) or negative (inhibitory). You should
    hardcode GAIN and OFFSET as numeric values, you don't need to create
    variables using those names.
  <p></p>
  <p>

    The OFFSET determines the motor speed with no sensor input (e.g., when the bot is far from all light sources).
    The GAIN determines how strongly the sensors influence the motors. Your controller code should not manipulate
    any other bot parameters. It should use the sensor values to set the motor values, and nothing more. The base
    code will take care of everything else.
    (The base code limits the overall bot speed to 5 pixels/tick, and the overall turning rate to 0.1 radians/tick.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Your controllers must use just 2 lines of code, as shown above.
      <br>You cannot use "if" statements in your code!
      <br>Each controller must agree with Braitenberg's description of the
      architecture (crossed vs. uncrossed, excitation vs. inhibition)</b>
  </p>
  <p>

    The base code will automatically score the behavior as
    "PASSED" or "FAILED", based on criteria that must be met in the first
    1000 ticks of the simulation. Detailed scoring criteria can be found in
    the World.js file.
  </p>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>After duplicating the template file, edit the section at the top of
      index.html to supply your name and last 3 digits of your UIN.
      The simulation will not run until you enter a valid 3-digit ID.

    </li>
    <li>Implement <b>aggressive (red)</b>:
      bots should repeatedly "hit" the light;
      there should be at least 8 total "hits" in the first 1000 ticks

    </li>
    <li>Implement <b>coward (yellow)</b>:
      bots should "flee" from the light;
      trajectories should generally remain outside of the yellow circle;
      bots should move slowly (speed &lt; 0.25) when outside of the yellow circle

    </li>
    <li>Implement <b>explorer (magenta)</b>:
      bots should move quickly when they are outside of the yellow circle
      (speed &gt; 2); trajectories should sometimes enter the blue cirlce,
      but not enter the red circle
    </li>
    <li>Implement <b>love (blue)</b>:
      bots should approach the light and come to a stop with their midpoint
      positioned between the red and blue reference circles
    </li>
  </ol>
