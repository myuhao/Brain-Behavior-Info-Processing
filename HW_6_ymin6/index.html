  <h2>HW06 - Evolve Braitenberg</h2>
  <p>In this assignment, you will evolve Braitenberg controllers that use up to 6 genes:
    </p><pre>    mtrL = genes[0] + genes[1] * snsL + genes[2] * snsR;
    mtrR = genes[3] + genes[4] * snsL + genes[5] * snsR;
    </pre>
  During evolution, you can control which genes are active, and restrict their values using the
  <code>lowerBound</code> and <code>upperBound</code> variables. For example, setting
  the lowerBound and upperBound for a gene to zero, silences the gene.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>What value of bot.genes corresponds to a Braitenberg "aggressive" controller,
      with left/right motor offsets of 3 and crossed-connection strengths of 9?<br>
      <user>Your answer here</user>
    </li>
    <li>Enter this value for bot.genes in the top textbox;
      click "Reset" and then "Run/Pause". Describe the bot's behavior.<br>
      <user>Your answer here</user>
    </li>
    <li>Leaving bot.genes as above, click "Run Expt". What is the mean
      fitness and max fitness of this controller? Why do they differ?<br>
      <user>Mean fitness: x.x (should less than 10)</user><br>
      <user>Max fitness: xx</user><br>
      <user>Explanation</user>
    </li>
    <li>Leave the genes as above, but change the offset of the LEFT motor only from 3 to 4.
      What is the mean and max fitness of this controller?
      Why is the mean fitness so much higher than in question 3?<br>
      <user>Mean fitness: xxx.x (should greater than 100)</user><br>
      <user>Max fitness: xx</user><br>
      <user>Explanation</user>
    </li>
    <li>Now we will try to evolve an even more effective crossed-connection controller.
      What values of lowerBound and upperBound would allow the motor offset
      genes to vary between -9 to 9, the crossed-connection strengths to vary between
      -99 to 99, and the uncrossed connection strengths to be zero?<br>
      <user>lowerBound: [ x, x, x, x, x, x]</user><br>
      <user>upperBound: [ x, x, x, x, x, x]</user>
    </li>
    <li>In the GA textbox, choose initial values of popSize, crossoverRate,
        mutationRate, and specify the lowerBound and upperBound from above.
       Click "GA Reset" and then "GA Run."
      Evolution will stop automatically after 50 generations.
      If necessary, readjust popSize, crossoverRate and mutationRate and re-evolve.
      What are the Best genome and Best fit values that you obtained (shown in blue)?<br>
      <user>Best gene: [ x, x, x, x, x, x]</user><br>
      <user>Best fit: xxx(should be greater than 200) </user>
    </li>
    <li>Click "GA Load Best" to transfer this genome to the upper dialog box. Click
      "Reset" and "Run/Pause". Describe the bot behavior. How does it differ from the
      behavior observed in Question #4?<br>
      <user>Your answer here</user>
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the relative signs of the two motor offsets? What does this imply about
      the bot behavior when it doesn't have any sensory input?<br>
        <user>Your answer here</user>
    </li>
    <li>Now evolve a controller that allows both crossed and uncrossed connections.
      Report the gene and fitness values below. Does allowing both crossed and uncrossed
      connections seem to improve performance, degrade performance, or have little effect?<br>
      <user>Best gene: [ x, x, x, x, x, x]</user><br>
      <user>Best fit: xxx</user><br>
      <user>Answer question</user>
    </li>
    <li>Now evolve a controller under the constraints that gene 0 is fixed at -5,
      genes 1 and 2 are fixed at zero, gene 3 can vary between -9 and 9, gene 4 is fixed
      at zero and gene 5 can vary between -99 and 99.
      Report the best gene and fitness values that you obtained:<br>
      <user>Best gene: [ x, x, x, x, x, x]</user><br>
      <user>Best fit: xxx (should be greater than 50)</user><br>
    </li>
    <li>Use "GA Load Best" to load this genome into the simulator. Run the simulation
      and describe the bot behavior.  Is this a surprising mode of foraging? Would you have
      been likely to discover this on your own without using a GA?<br>

    </li>
  </ol>
