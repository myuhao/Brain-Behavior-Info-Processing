    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>When the bot moves in the given 300-pixel circular trajectory,
      approximately how many pellets are collected in one loop around the circle (314 ticks)?<br>
      <user>Among the five runs, there were 19, 28, 29, 29, 30 pellets collected in each run.</user>
    </li>
    <li>Approximately how many pellets are collected if the simulation continues to run for 2000 ticks?<br>
      <user>Among the five runs, there were 23, 25, 23, 31, 33 pellets collected in each run.</user>
    </li>
      <li>What would be a more efficient movement strategy for the bot to use over
        long time scales to optimize foraging efficiency?<br>
      <user>The agent should not follow a fixed trajectory. The fixed trajectory prevent the agent from collecting newly distrubuted food that is outside of the trajectory. A possible approach is to allow the agent to move randomly in the arena.</user>
    </li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: after saving and submitting your HW solution, duplicate the project and try to implment
      a more efficient foraging strategy by changing the code in bot.update().
      <br>Try to avoid using information that the bot cannot sense directly.
      <br>If you like, you may submit your modified version with the subject "HW02-OPTIONAL"
      <br>I will look at it, but it won't be graded.
      <br><user>The heading direction of the bot is randomized at every update to "cover more ground".</user>
      </li>
    </ol>
